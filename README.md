This code will represent the match score in tennis score format. The code takes an array of scores in this case it's either 0 or 1 which represent whose score it is, 
then it takes 0 or 1 as second argument as the server and a positive, odd-valued integer indicating the maximum length of the match.
0 means player 1 and 1 means player 2.

As the results the code will give the output of the total matches, the number of sets played, and all the score for the game. <br />
